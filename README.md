# BridgeFuncRecovery
This project aims to probabilistically model the post-earthquake functional recovery of bridges. The source codes are programmed in Python.

The theoretical background is documented in the paper:	Wu, C., Burton, H., Zsarnóczay, A., Chen. S., Xie. Y., Terzić, V., Günay, S., Padgett, J., Mieler, and M., Almufti, I. (2024+). “Modeling Post-earthquake Functional Recovery of Bridges.” Earthquake Spectra (under review).
